# duplicate-code is spammy and cannot be disabled locally, known pylint bug:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/214 but it's actually helpful for
# refactoring, same with the other two here (missing-docstring,invalid-name)
# they are fine in theory in any real django project they will generate tons
# of spam (from urlpatterns to missing docstrings for every __str__ method)
